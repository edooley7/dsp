# Learn Statistics

Read Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/) for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. Both books are completely available online, or you can buy physical copies if you would like.

Some people enjoy video content such as Khan Academy's [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) or the much longer and more in-depth Harvard [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo). You might also be interested in the book [Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) or a very short [overview](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/the-math-you-need-to-start/) from School of Data.
